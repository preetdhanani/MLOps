# MLOps: Industry-Ready Machine Learning Pipeline with MLflow

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end MLOps architecture**, designed to mimic how machine learning pipelines are built and managed in real-world production environments. Developed as part of my Master’s in Artificial Intelligence & Robotics, this repository focuses on modular design, reproducibility, experiment tracking, and automation.

---

## Project Goals

- Simulate an **industry-standard MLOps pipeline**
- Apply modular development from data ingestion to model evaluation 
- Use **MLflow** for experiment tracking
- Implement **CI/CD workflows** using GitHub Actions
- Prepare for deployment and scaling

## Pipeline Overview

Each pipeline stage is modular and traceable:

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   Reads raw data and stores it for processing.

2. **Data Validation**  
   Ensures the input data adheres to the expected schema.

3. **Data Transformation**  
   Handles missing values, encodes features, and scales and divide in train and test data.

4. **Model Training**  
   Trains the ML model and logs metrics using MLflow.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   Compares predictions and evaluates the model using predefined metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core language
- **MLflow** – Experiment tracking
- **PyYAML** – Configuration management
- **Flask** – Simple web app for inference
- **GitHub Actions** – Automating workflows
- **Docker** – Containerization

## Analyze the parameters in dagshub(MLFlow)
use this like for getting access thought its already in project
    https://dagshub.com/preetdhanani/MLOps.mlflow

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/preetdhanani/MLOps.git
cd MLOps
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or use venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🌐 Run the Flask Web Interface

This project includes a simple **Flask-based interface** to manually trigger the model training process via a web browser.

### Step 1: Start the Flask App

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the server at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

### Step 2: Trigger Model Training from the Browser

To start model training:

1. Open your browser

2. Go to:
    http://localhost:8080/train

This will:

    Automatically run the training pipeline (stage_04_model_trainer.py)

    Log the training run in MLflow

    Return a success or error message in the browser

### Step 3: Prediction

After training come back to main page and start entering your values then press the button to see the result
